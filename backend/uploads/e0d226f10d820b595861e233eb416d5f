# PHYSICS NOTES: MOTION (KINEMATICS) - CLASS 10 CBSE

## 1. BASIC CONCEPTS

* **Rest:** An object is at rest if it does not change its position with respect to its surroundings.
* **Motion:** An object is in motion if it changes its position over time.
* **Distance (Scalar):** The actual path length travelled. (Unit: meters)
* **Displacement (Vector):** The shortest distance between the starting and ending point. (Unit: meters)

> **Key Rule:** Distance is always >= Displacement.

## 2. SPEED AND VELOCITY

* **Speed:** Distance travelled per unit time.
Formula: Speed = Distance / Time
* **Velocity:** Displacement per unit time.
Formula: Velocity = Displacement / Time
* **Average Speed:** Total Distance / Total Time
* **Uniform Motion:** When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time.

## 3. ACCELERATION

Acceleration (a) is the rate of change of velocity.

**Formula:** a = (v - u) / t

Where:

* u = initial velocity
* v = final velocity
* t = time taken
* Unit: m/s^2 (meters per second squared)
* **Positive Acceleration:** Velocity is increasing.
* **Retardation (Negative Acceleration):** Velocity is decreasing.

## 4. EQUATIONS OF MOTION (Very Important)

Use these when an object moves with "Uniform Acceleration":

1. **First Equation:** v = u + at
(Relates velocity and time)
2. **Second Equation:** s = ut + 0.5 * a * t^2
(Relates position and time)
3. **Third Equation:** v^2 = u^2 + 2as
(Relates velocity and position)

## 5. GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS

Graphs are a common way to solve kinematics problems in CBSE exams:

* **Distance-Time Graph:** - Slope of the line = Speed.
* A straight diagonal line means Constant Speed.



* **Velocity-Time Graph:**
* Slope of the line = Acceleration.
* Area under the line = Total Displacement.

## 6. UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

When an object moves in a circle at a constant speed:

* The speed is constant, but **velocity is changing** (because the direction changes).
* It is called an "Accelerated Motion."

**Formula for Velocity:**
v = (2 * pi * r) / t

(where r = radius of the circle)
