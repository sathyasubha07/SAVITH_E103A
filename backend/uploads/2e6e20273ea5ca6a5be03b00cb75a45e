## 1. Basic Concepts

* **Rest and Motion:** Rest and motion are relative terms. An object may be at rest with respect to one observer but in motion with respect to another.
* **Scalar Quantities:** Quantities that have only magnitude (e.g., Distance, Speed).
* **Vector Quantities:** Quantities that have both magnitude and direction (e.g., Displacement, Velocity).

### Distance vs. Displacement

| Feature | Distance | Displacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Total path length covered by an object. | The shortest straight-line path between initial and final points. |
| **Type** | Scalar quantity. | Vector quantity. |
| **Value** | Always positive; cannot be zero if motion occurs. | Can be positive, negative, or zero. |

## 2. Speed and Velocity

* **Speed:** The rate of change of distance.

* **Velocity:** The rate of change of displacement (speed in a specific direction).

* **Average Speed:** Total distance divided by total time.
* **Uniform Motion:** When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time.

## 3. Acceleration

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It occurs if the speed changes, the direction changes, or both change.

* ****: Initial velocity
* ****: Final velocity
* ****: Time taken
* **S.I. Unit**: 
* **Retardation:** Negative acceleration (when an object slows down).

## 4. Graphical Representation of Motion

Graphs are essential for visualizing how an object moves over time.

* **Distance-Time Graph:**
* The **slope** of a distance-time graph represents **Speed**.
* A straight line indicates uniform speed.


* **Velocity-Time Graph:**
* The **slope** of a velocity-time graph represents **Acceleration**.
* The **area under the curve** represents **Displacement**.

## 5. Equations of Motion (For Uniform Acceleration)

These three equations describe the relationship between , , , , and  (distance/displacement).

1. **First Equation (Velocity-Time):** 
2. **Second Equation (Position-Time):** 
3. **Third Equation (Position-Velocity):**

## 6. Uniform Circular Motion

When an object moves in a circular path with constant speed, it is called Uniform Circular Motion.

* **Note:** Even if the speed is constant, the **velocity is changing** because the direction of motion changes at every point. Therefore, circular motion is always an **accelerated motion**.
* **Velocity Formula:**  (where  is the radius).
